0. check clustering, failover and drives for v-instances
	that is required in the restore step

select * from sys.dm_io_cluster_shared_drives

1. alias creation

2. is there any sql agent job not owned by dba ?
	>> looked at the list.

21. block server

3. Copy logins
	>>note - shared servers - check db users already present on target server

	if required:
	run MoveSQLLogins_2000_or_2005.sql
	>> run exec sp_help_revlogin on the source server:
		copy results
	>> run the generated script onto 2008 target server

3a. kill all connections

3b. Make the source db read-only

4. backup database
	find out - space used by the source database
	use backup database script
	run on source server, master

5. restore database
	use GUI

	alternatively,
	use script files_list to obtain logical file names from the backup files
	use restore database script
	run on target server, master

5b. Make the target db read-write


6. delete bogus schema
	if there are objects owned by bogus schema, transfer their ownership, using
	else it will prevent you from dropping the user associated

--alter schema dbo transfer bogus_schema.object

7. delete app-specific (non-standard) users
	I would delete users from newly restored databases from target server
	this makes sure that new dbs don't have object level grants

	do NOT touch dbo, info schema, guest, sys etc

8. create standard roles and sp

	run script standard_roles

	alternatively,
	use dbaweb to navigate from target server to new db to Roles to Audit
	use the script at the bottom to run on new db
	verify audit again - it should show adherence (green)

9. set database options
	this changes owner to sa
	sets compatibility level, recovery page verify to checksum

10. add users back to new db
	if any sql logins, EXEC sp_change_users_login 'Update_One', 'sql_login', 'sql_user'

11. identify orphan db users by executing script sqlloginAudit
	>> delete orphan users

12. rebuild all indexes. may like to set appropriate fillfactor

13. udpate statistics by using -- don't do this
exec sp_MSforeachtable 'UPDATE STATISTICS ? WITH FULLSCAN'




14. update dbaweb
	update server tracker on the new server
	edit new dtabase to update application, description/comments from old one
	edit old db/server. add comment as 'migrated. target server name'

15. update IDR for prod

16. do not detach old dbs until prod migration is cimplete. you may take old db offline in non-prod. detach old db in prod.
