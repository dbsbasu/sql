--restore: general notes
questions. how to know which ful backup is the base for a specific diff backup?
-or- which diff backups can be restored based off of the full backup?
answer. database_backup_lsn of a diff backup will match the checkpoint_lsn of its 
base full backup.

for that matter, database_backup_lsn of a diff and tlog backup will match 
checkpoint_lsn of its base full backup.

question. how to recognize the right tran log backup that should be applied 
after a diff (or full) bkup?
answer. look for the tran log bkup for which the first and last lsn covers 
the value of the last lsn of the diff backup in question.
in other words, the last lsn of the diff (or full) backup should fall between 
first and last lsn of the log backup.

question. how to ensure that we are applying the right tran log backups 
one after the other?
answer. the last lsn of the previous log bkup should be the first lsn of 
the next log bkup.

first lsn is where the corresponding backup starts. 
(last lsn - 1) is included in the said bkup.

if you have a copy_only full backup taken, database_backup_lsn of the subsequent 
diff backups would still point to the checkpoint_lsn of the last regular full backup. 
copy only backup does not reset the diff bit map page for an extent 
and that is how the copy_only full bkup does not interrup the following diff bkups. 
the diff bkups still continue to point to its original base regular full backup.
